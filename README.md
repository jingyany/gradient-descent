# Gradient Descent for L2-regularized Logistic Regression

This code implements the gradient descent algorithm to solve L2-regularized logistic regression. 

See the gradient_descent_simulated.py file for an example of applying gradient descent algorithm to solve L2-regularized logistic regression problem on simulated data. To run this example, simply load packages and run the gradient_descent_simulated.py file using Python:

'''
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
python gradient_descent_simulated.py
'''
